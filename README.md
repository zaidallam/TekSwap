## About The Project

This is a proof-of-concept dApp that allows users to buy and sell an ERC-20 token (TekToken) using Ethereum. This decentralized exchange could easily be expanded to include virtually any crypto currency with some modifications to the contract and, of course, front end. The project features an aesthetic design with features such as an identicon for the connected wallet and built-in balance checking. Although simple, this dApp has lays the fundamental groundwork for a much larger decentralized exchange.
This is a one-page concept project that was built using several frameworks and libraries, including but not limited to the Truffle Suite, OpenZeppelin Ethers, Next, and Tailwind.
